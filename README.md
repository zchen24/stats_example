Statistics Examples 
==================

Matlab code to summarize basic statistic procedures. Example datas are from the
Statistics Unplugged 3rd Edition book. In the example file, I first show how to
compute the value directly using Matlab built-in functions, then show how to
manually compute these values. 

### List of Files
* ch02.m: Central Tendency (mean,median,mode) and Variability(var,std)
* ch03.m: The shape of distribution, plot 1-2-3 rule
* ch10.m: Chi-Square
